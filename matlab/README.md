<h2 align="center">Brain Tumor Detection Using MRI Images With CNN In MATLAB</h1>

<p align="justify">
This attempt to use the Computer Vision Toolbox and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) in MATLAB is based on the term project of the Biomedical Information Systems lecture. 

The system developed on MATLAB is trained to accurately classify tumors by processing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. 

Since I want to learn the Simulink and CNN in MATLAB for other projects, I adapt the requirements of this project to my own learning needs. I hope I've demonstrated my desire to learn with this part of the project.
